This codebase contains the **Nokia MixRadio C# SDK**.

##Overview
The **Nokia MixRadio C# SDK** (formally the Nokia Music SDK) lets you easily integrate your Windows Phone with [Nokia MixRadio on Nokia Lumia phones](http://nokia.ly/musicapp)
or your Windows 8 applicaton with [Nokia MixRadio on Windows 8](http://nokia.ly/musicappwin8).
The API offers two levels of integration; the simplest and quickest to get going is to use the high-level Launcher Tasks, with more advanced integration available to perform searches and get recommendations within your app.

## Launcher Tasks
The [launcher APIs in Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff769550.aspx) allow an application to integrate with common operating system tasks such as taking a picture, finding an address or a contact, making a call, or saving a ring tone with very little effort. 

With the high-level Launchers, you can perform the following using the new app-to-app APIs that Nokia MixRadio supports on Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8:

- Launch the Nokia MixRadio app
- Search for music
- Show Artist details
- Show Gigs nearby
- Show available mixes
- Show product details
- Play a mix 
 
## API Methods
With the lower-level API access, you get more control and can perform the following use cases within your app:

- Search for content
- Get top artists
- Get charts
- Get new releases
- Get a list of genres
- Get albums and tracks by an artist
- Get artist recommendations
- Get a list of available mixes

## New User Data API Methods
New in v3.x, you can access user data (provided the user authorises your app!):

- Read the user's play history
- Read the user's top artists
